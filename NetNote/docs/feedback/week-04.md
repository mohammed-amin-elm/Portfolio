# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- TIP: Consider adding subpoints with indentation for the talking points, rather than putting multiple questions on one line
- Great use of inform/brainstorm/etc tags!
- Very thorough agenda points made things extremely clear, keep this up!
- Agenda added in time


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Good merging and formatting of notes!
- TIP: The notes might actually be easier to read if they were integrated into the agenda text, rather than placed below it!
- Really detailed so that even a missing person would be able to understand what happened during the meeting
- Division of tasks is present in the notes, which is great and should be maintained! However, there could be slightly more detail there than just "Git and post" or "database"


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- TIP: The meeting got sidetracked at times by other team members, and the chair did not step into keep the meeting on track. The agenda should be followed more closely and directly
- TIP: The chair was rather passive, sometimes feeling like other team members were the ones actually chairing - the chair should be more present in the meeting
- TIP: A lot of periods of silence occurred, which means time may have been wasted - try to plan around discussions or other points that would involve more active talking
- Some topics ("Discuss the issues") took FAR longer than projected


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient-Good

Feedback: 

- TIP: A lot of extended periods of silence occurred, which means time may have been wasted - try to plan around discussions or other points that would involve more active talking
- Ownership of the meeting - the TA did not really have to step in!
- Decently well-spread talking time between most members
- Each idea/comment did seem to be taken into account!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Functional markdown rendering, note storage and search on server!
- Changes you showed were from main branch, do keep this up
- Last week you didn't have an app to show, but now it appears that almost all the basic requirements are done - this is amazing progress and you should have time to implement a lot of the additional features
- TIP: The presentation had some NullPointerException-type hiccups - the fact you forgot to select something means a real user probably would too - this is a user experience issue that should be fixed (e.g. with a default selection)


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- TIP: You did discuss last week's process, but discussing last week's action list per-person more directly and in more detail would allow for better reflection and make things more transparent for me
- TIP: Going by MRs and LOC, some members had 300+ LOC (officially 800 but I was informed that this was due to refactoring others' code), while others had < 150. Work should be spread out more evenly, including splitting up issues more in case they are large enough to take several hundred lines. Having multiple small issues would also improve the process rubrics!
- TIP: It feels like some members contributed large features while others took on only smaller tasks. As above, issues should be split more, not just into features but step-by-step technical aspects to make them smaller.
- Decently well-spread contributions in talking time between most members
