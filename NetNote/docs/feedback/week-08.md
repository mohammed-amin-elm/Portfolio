# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Agenda detailed enough to follow and prepare for
- Template used well, including timing and talking point tags!
- Agenda decently on time, TIP: adding the agenda more than a day before the meeting would likely allow people more time to prepare


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good-Excellent

Feedback: 

- Previous week's notes merged in good time!
- Note formatting is very easy to read, including markdown features like bolding for emphasis, and specific timings!
- Detailed enough, would be easy to understand what happened during the meeting
- TIP: Agreements should be SMART, and assigned to people - this is essentially one of the most important outputs of the meeting!


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Good approach to following the agenda
- TIP: Multiple agenda points went over time - try to pay attention to this more, and remind participants if something is taking too long


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent-Good

Feedback: 

- Team's voice was very present in the meeting, I didn't steer it (though more questions for me this time around!)
- Talking time was decently spread out (though some people only really talked when asked)
- Atmosphere was constructive, good listening and sharing of ideas


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Application demo shown from main!
- Multi-Collection appears mostly functional (apart from bugs when running multiple clients)
- Interconnected Content seems well-polished
- Other extra features do not appear, though are apparently in development
- Basic requirements appear functional (aside from refreshing between clients)
- Progress appears alright, but may not be enough to get all extra features 
- TIP: Ensure you focus on getting extra features to work, and that the ones you do implement are implemented well (0.8 vs 0.4 points per feature)
- You can likely get multiple extra features working if you maintain pace/accelerate, and focus your efforts on these features (and ensure they work bug-free)


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- TIP: There wasn't any discussion of last week's tasks - this is vital for an actual professional sprint meeting!
- There appears to be decent progress, but I can not fully tell because it was not discussed
- Contributed LOC appear somewhat lopsided - really focus this week on giving everyone focused tasks to work on to improve additional features
