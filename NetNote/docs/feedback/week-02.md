# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

Your talking points were very specific and clear, allowing everyone to follow along easily.
The template was used correctly, with times filled in and the talking points listed in the correct place.
This is exactly the right structure! (Though you could make it even better by tagging each talking point with inform/brainstorm/etc.)
The file was uploaded 15 minutes before the meeting, so next time please upload it at least the day before, ideally!


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

The chair successfully followed the agenda, staying on topic for the entire meeting.
However, the time estimates were off, and the meeting ran before schedule, with most of the points taking significantly less time than expected.
I also felt that a lot of the meeting time was spent on the chair talking, rather than group discussion.
For next time, you can use today's actual timings to adjust the estimates for next week, so you can accurately decide how much time each agenda item should take.
It would be amazing if the chair stimulated more discussion between members, especially including those that didn't speak much.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

Given it was the first meeting with little preparation expected from us, the team did very well in taking ownership of the meeting.
That's great because in future meetings I will talk even less, and the team seems prepared to handle the meetings themselves.
The level of discussion, particularly comparing the more and less talkative members, was sufficient for this week.
However, I believe that in Week 3 and onwards, the different attendees should be more directly involved, even by asking them questions directly if required.
The atmosphere was constructive though, with everyone who did decide to speak having their voices heard.
