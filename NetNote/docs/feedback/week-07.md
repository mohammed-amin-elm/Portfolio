# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda added decently in time (day before), TIP: team members would likely be better prepared if it was there on Monday
- Good use of template - with all necessary elements, and timing for each section
- Well detailed (albeit short) agenda! Enough detail so people could prepare
- TIP: Try to use the (inform/discuss/etc.) tags per talking point, they make you think about why each point belongs in the agenda, and what you want to accomplish while talking


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Notes merged into agenda in good time!
- Very thorough notes, which would be useful even if you didn't attend the meeting
- TIP: Agreements should be more concrete - "UI improvement" or "we should focus on making UI better, and easier for the user" do not fit the SMART model, and it's hard to use the notes to figure out exact planning for the coming week


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Great following of agenda precisely point-by-point
- Good share of talking time between chair and participants
- TIP: Some timing discrepancies  with the agenda - for instance "Additional features" discussion took notably more than 4 min - try to plan for these more realistically in the agenda, especially by comparing to past agendas and what went well there


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Good initiative in asking the group for opinions during discussions
- Team took full ownership of the meeting!
- Great speaking time division - everyone seemed to contribute well to the meeting
- Atmosphere felt very constructive, people added their thoughts when appropriate
- No one's contributions were ignored!

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Application demo shown from main!
- Basic requirements appear to be essentially all working
- Doesn't appear to be that much progress on additional requirements aside from Multi-Collection - these are vital to getting a higher grade for Implemented Features
- TIP: Ensure you don't slow down from here until W9, these weeks are crucial for completing the project

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: (In)Sufficient

Feedback: 

- TIP: There weren't any mentions of whether people completed the previous sprints' goal - the sprint retrospective is a crucial part of real sprint meetings, and you should make sure to give a review of what you did
- TIP: You could reflect on your action list from last week, for instance saying per person if you achieved your goals, why/why not, and what could be done better - this lets you improve week-by-week
- TIP: LOC per person varied, with some substantially below 100 - ensure everyone has at least 100 lines of Java code per week
