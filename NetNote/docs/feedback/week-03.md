# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda added 1 day early, which is good, and should be maintained
- TIP: time per talking point item was allocated in a way that ended up way under the 45 minute expected time frame for the entire meeting, more time should be allocated to talking points
- Template used appropriately, including talking points, and timings for everything!
- You successfully used the (Inform/brainstorm/etc.) tags to tag your subpoints for greater clarity
- Individual points were clear, presenting them as questions makes them very easy to understand
- TIP: Add subpoints to each talking point, with an extra level of indentation, so you can elaborate more on each point

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient-Good

Feedback: 

- TIP: The meeting minutes should be merged into the respective agenda file, rather than placed anywhere else in the repository
- TIP: The meeting minutes should be in markdown format (since they're part of the same file as the agenda)
- The notes are detailed enough for anyone to understand, even for someone who wasn't at the actual meeting
- Action points for the entire team ("All team members to complete self-studies by Monday morning") were used to good effect, are actionable and realistic
- TIP: For all future meetings where tasks are assigned to individual people, similar action points but aimed at specific people (X does Y) should be included


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Chair followed the agenda, though extra points were improvised when the Talking Points ran out early in the meeting
- TIP: More time was taken per talking point than expected in the agenda, though the meeting finished in time, so the agenda timings should be adjusted
- Great approach with using the Opening by chair section to summarise all future talking points, this orients the team well
- TIP: Slight reliance on TA (though not major) for one part, the meeting should basically be ran entirely by the chair with only the TA Announcements done by the TA
- Dividing tasks between members during the meeting is exactly what we expect from you, be sure to do this during each future meeting!

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- TIP: Good ownership of the meeting, though with some amount of random questions asked to the TA, which should be placed towards the end/minimized
- Good discussion atmosphere, there was room for anyone to make a point
- Great level of involvement between team members and equal contribution to the discussion, keep this up!

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Not Applicable for this week

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- TIP: 1 cleanup MR and 1 code MR by 2 different people were submitted before the meeting, which is reasonable given it's the first code week, but all members should submit MRs every week
- TIP: Last week of course did not have an action list, but from next week, include a discussion of the previous week's action list (which should include what everyone's goals are)
- Discussion during meeting felt well balanced, with great, equal contributions per person
