# Meeting

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Notes integrated into the agenda, and on the same day as the meeting!
- TIP: Notes are informative enough, though some lack detail (e.g. the entire "Issues" segment, from 16:08 to 16:20, contains very little text), which means it might be hard to understand what was happening during the meeting if you looked back
- The agreements that *are present* are specific, actionable, realistic, and people are assigned to tasks!
- TIP: Action points are slightly vague, just "x will work on y", it might bring more clarity if it was elaborated on where exactly they are, and what they have left to do from now
