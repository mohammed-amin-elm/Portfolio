# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good-Sufficient

Feedback:

- IMPROVEMENT: Agenda was in an MR but not merged at the start of labs - consider merging it before Wednesdays. Additionally, the MR included some code fixes, and those should be separate!
- Detailed enough subpoints
- IMPROVEMENT: The discuss/inform/... tags were not used for talking points, and I believe they could make the intent of your talking points more clear
- IMPROVEMENT: The template appears to be mangled, without proper indentation when rendered in GitLab - this makes it harder to read
- Happy to see issue creation and distribution included, and done well!
- IMPROVEMENT: Deciding to add large CC&CR rubric discussion at the end of the meeting was not optimal, addition could have first been mentioned near the start (Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions?)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- IMPROVEMENT: Consider interspersing your notes into the original agenda, instead of adding them to the bottom - this would make it more clear which notes correspond to what, and make them easier to read
- Notes were very thorough and helpful!
- IMPROVEMENT: The action points (under "summarize action points") are the most important output of the meeting! I don't see a specific assignment to concrete team members, which means individuals from team might not have a clear idea of what they're working on - there should be concrete agreements and task assignment to people!


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Great strict following of agenda
- Appropriate timing of most agenda points, and good time allocation
- IMPROVEMENT: Time for issue creation and allocation was very underestimated, make sure you allocate appropriate time to these next time
- No long periods of silence, etc.
- Good splitting of issues between members - this is exactly the point of this meeting!


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Everyone appeared involved, which is great progress (though I saw more phones out than I'd hope for)
- Good atmosphere and ownership
- Involvement of online participants was done well! Keep this up for future online meetings, since it's crucial for having attendance
- Everyone's voices seemed to be heard


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- IMPROVEMENT: Application demo first not shown on main, and instead on local branch that was behind main - always use the most recent main branch for the demo
- Basic requirements seemed functional, which means you're on track, and there's good progress - you're now working on extra features!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Good job reflecting on last week's tasks, this is a great thing to have in the agenda
- IMPROVEMENT: LOC report shows some spread, with some people contributing 400 lines, and others <100. This is a rather uneven distribution, and it would likely be more productive to split tasks up between members more!
- From sprint review, tasks sound evenly split (though the total work per person may not be even)
